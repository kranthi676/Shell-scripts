Shell : 

The shell provides you with an interface to the UNIX system.

It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. 

When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

A shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. 

There are different flavors of shells, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. 

Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions

DOS = Command.com
Windows3.1/windows NT 3.x = program manager
Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP = Windows Explorer

Types of Shell : 

K-Shell David Korn (not free)

C-Shell (Based on C-programming Language)

Bash = Bourne Again Shell.

Variables
The .profile or .bash_profile files in your home directory. These files are used to set environmental items for a users shell.
/etc/profile file is not very different however it is used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.
/etc/profile.d
In addition to the setting environmental items the /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh. If you plan on setting your own system wide environmental variables it is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within /etc/profile.d.

.bashrc file in your home directory. This file is meant for setting command aliases and functions used by bash shell users.
 The /etc/bashrc is setting command aliases  in system wide 


conditional code

True/false

ls
echo $? 
0
ls dd
echo $?
2
true
echo $?
0
false
echo $?
1


Conditional command execution

command1 && command2

command3 || command4

cp abc xyz && echo the file was copied okay (if the abc and xyz exists and then excute echo )

ls file2 || ls 

if the command exists error and then run the second command

IF STATEMENT

Syntax

if command1
 then
    command2
    command3
....
fi

example :


if diff file1 file2 > /dev/null
 then
    echo The files are the same
    rm file2
fi


Else clause:

if command1
then
one set of commands
else
another set of commands
fi


if the first set of commands exits non-zero then excute second set of commands

if the second set condition is met then close the loop



example:

if diff file1 file2 > /dev/null
 then
echo the files are the same
rm file2
else
echo the files are different!
echo please review the differences:
diff file1 file2
fi
else clause example 2 :

#!/bin/bash
if ls nofile > /dev/null
then
: # ":" is the "do nothing" command
else
echo the file does not exist --exiting...
exit
fi

elif syntax : 

if command1
then
command set 1
elif command2
then
command set 2
else
command set 3
fi

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter value of i :" i

if [ $i -eq 5 ]
then
    echo "Value of i is 5"

Comparisons statement

Test

var1=10
test $var1 = 20
echo $?

if test $var1 -gt $max
then
echo That value is too large 
fi

Test$var1 = 20

Spaces are must and should

Example

x=
test $x = 20
-bash: test: =: unary operator expected
test "$x" = 20

test -f /etc/passwd

echo $?

test -d .
echo $?

dir=/etc/garbage
test -d $dir
echo $?

test ! 

! = not

example

test ! -w /etc/passwd

echo $?

example of test :

#!/bin/bash
echo -n "please enter a filename: "
read fname
if test -z "$fname"
then
echo "you did not enter a filename"
elif test -f "$fname" -a -w "$fname"
then
echo "Every thing is fine"
else
echo "The file is not a writable file"
fi

here -a = and 

here -z = to check the file is exists or not 

test also have feature ( -o = or ) either of the condition 

Comparisons:
-eq	equal to
-ne	not equal to
-lt	less than
-le	less than or equal to
-gt	greater than
-ge	greater than or equal to

File Operations:
-s	file exists and is not empty
-f	file exists and is not a directory
-d	directory exists
-x	file is executable
-w	file is writable
-r	file is readable

test also can achive 

#!/bin/bash
echo -n "please enter a filename: "
read fname
if [ -z "$fname" ]
then
echo "you did not enter a filename"
elif [ -f "$fname" -a -w "$fname" ]
then
echo "Every thing is fine"
else
echo "The file is not a writable file"
fi

Text Processing

wc -l : Prints the number of lines in a file.
wc -w : prints the number of words in a file.
wc -c : Displays the count of bytes in a file.
wc -m : prints the count of characters from a file.
wc -L : prints only the length of the longest line in a file.
ls -l | wc

-r Option: Sorting In Reverse Order

sort -r inputfile.txt

-n Option 

To sort a file numerically used –n option. -n option is also predefined in unix as the above options are. This option is used to sort the file with numeric data present inside.

sort -n file1.txt

-nr option

-nr option : To sort a file with numeric data in reverse order we can use the combination of two options as stated below.


sort 

employee.txt

manager  5000
clerk    4000
employee  6000
peon     4500
director 9000
guard     3000

sort -k 2n employee.txt

-c option : This option is used to check if the file given is already sorted or not & checks if a file is already sorted pass the -c option to sort. This will write to standard output if there are lines that are out of order.The sort tool can be used to understand if this file is sorted and which lines are out of order
Example :

filename.txt

Audi
Cadillac
BMW
Dodge

Command :
$ sort -c cars.txt
Output :
sort: cars.txt:3: disorder: BMW
 Note : If there is no output then the file is considered to be already sort

-u option : To sort and remove duplicates pass the -u option to sort. This will write a sorted list to standard output and remove duplicates.
This option is helpful as the duplicates being removed gives us an redundant file

filename.txt

Audi
BMW
Cadillac
BMW
Dodge


sort -u filename.txt

-M Option : To sort by month pass the -M option to sort. This will write a sorted list to standard output ordered by month name.

months.txt

February
January
March
August
September

sort -M months.txt

AWK

AWK

Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan

To print 

awk '{print "Welcome to awk command tutorial "}'

Using Variables

$0 for the whole line.
$1 for the first field.
$2 for the second field.
$n for the nth field.


Cat myfile 

This is a Test
This is a First Test
This is a Second Test
This is a Third Test


awk '{print $1}' myfile

Sometimes the separator in some files is not space nor tab but something else. You can specify it using –F option:

awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd

Using Multiple Commands

echo "Hello Tom" | awk '{$2="Adam"; print $0}'

Awk can take the following options:

-F fs     To specify a file separator.

-f file     To specify a file that contains awk script.

-v var=value     To declare a variable.

Example

backup_one_file()
{
cp $1 $backupdir
echo $1 has been backedup
}


backup_one_file report.txt

Each parameter 

$* = represents all the parameters 
$# = represents the number of parameter


#!/bin/bash
backup_these_files()
{
for fname #short for "for fname in $*"
do
cp $fname /tmp
echo $fname has been backed up
done
}
backup_these_files *.txt *.doc

Function Return Values

output
an exit status 
sample_func | wc -l Another Program
sample_func > file1 A file
output=`sample_func` Stored in a variable

Example 

Vaild_file{}
{
[ ! -r $1 ] && return 1
grep LOGFILE $1 > /dev/null || return 1
return 0 
}

Return statement terminates the execution of the current function 

Exit statement terminates the execution of the current shell 

which usually means that the shell script terminates and the user is left back at their login shell
